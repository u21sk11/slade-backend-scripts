# Overview
Front end is exposed as a single page application using [React](https://react.dev/) library. [Vite](https://vite.dev/) is used as the build tool.

Before proceeding here are some defintions:
- SPA (Single Page Application) - A single-page application is a web application or website that interacts with the user by dynamically rewriting the current web page with new data from the web server, instead of the default method of loading entire new pages. The goal is faster transitions that make the website feel more like a native app.
- React - a library for web and native user interfaces.
- Vite - Vite (French word for "quick", pronounced /vit/, like "veet") is a build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects. It consists of two major parts:
    - A dev server that provides rich feature enhancements over native ES modules, for example extremely fast Hot Module Replacement (HMR).
    - A build command that bundles your code with Rollup, pre-configured to output highly optimized static assets for production.
